## Debugging Wasm? Put some `whamm!` on it! ##

`whamm!` is a tool for "Wasm Application Monitoring and Manipulation"<sup>[1](#silent_h)</sup>, a DSL inspired by the D language.

## Getting Started ##
Take a look at the official [`whamm!` book](https://ejrgilbert.github.io/whamm/intro.html) for how to get started with this language.

### Build ###

To run basic build:
```shell
cargo build
```

### Test ###

To run tests:
```shell
cargo test
cargo test parser # Only run the tests for the `parser` module
cargo test -- --nocapture # With stdout tracing
```

### Run ###

To run project (there are example Scripts in `tests/scripts` folder):
```shell
cargo run -- instr --app <path_to_app_wasm> --script <path_to_script> <path_for_compiled_output>
```

To specify log level:
```shell
RUST_LOG={ error | warn | info | debug | trace | off } cargo run -- --app <path_to_app_wasm> --script <path_to_script> <path_for_compiled_output>
```

To visually debug the decision tree used during Wasm bytecode emission:
```shell
cargo run -- vis-script --script <path_to_script>
```

## Available Packages ##

NOTE: There was discussion for moving the probe `mode` to the front of the specification (e.g. `mode:provider:package:event`);
however, after thinking through this, I don't think it makes sense until I have a firmer grasp on the types of modes we will
have in this language. If there are more than before/after/alt (that are event-specific), then it would be confusing from a
language-intuition perspective. This is primarily because reading through the spec implies a movement from higher-to-lower
levels of granularity, everything being provided by what proceeds it. If we were to move `mode` to the front, but then have
event-specific options, this property would no longer hold.

Currently available: 
- `wasm:bytecode`

To be added:
- `thread` operation events
- `gc` operation events
- `function` enter/exit/unwind events
- `memory` access (read/write) events
- `table` access (read/write) events
- `component` operation events
- `BEGIN`/`END` events
- `traps`
- `exception` throw/rethrow/catch events

Example:
`wasi:http:send_req:alt`
`wasm:bytecode:call:alt`
`wasm:fn:enter:before`

# The book #

If you are wanting to deploy the book locally, use the following commands:
```bash
# Install the mdbook cargo package
cargo install mdbook

# Start the mdbook server and open the URL
cd docs
mdbook serve --open
```

This can be useful for offline learning OR for debugging documentation while doing updates (any local changes will automatically be updated in the served book pages).
