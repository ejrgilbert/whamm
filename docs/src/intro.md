# Introduction

Debugging Wasm? Put some `whamm!` on it!

`whamm!` is a tool for "Wasm Application Monitoring and Manipulation"<sup>[1](#silent_h)</sup>, a domain-specific language (DSL) inspired by [Dtrace's `D` language](https://illumos.org/books/dtrace).
If you're building a new _dynamic analysis_ for Wasm and are looking for a framework to support you, you're in the right place!
This book will help you [get on the right track](intro/getting_started.md) when working with the language.

`whamm!` enables Wasm tool implementers to express their instrumentation using high-level abstractions of program events or locations at various levels of granularity, increasing the expressiveness, intuitiveness, and maintainability of the tool.

Here are some of the goals of `whamm!`:
1. is **high-level** and **intuitive**
2. instrumentation is **easy-to-build**, [**testable**](intro/testing.md), and **debuggable**
3. express instrumentation in terms of [**predicated probes**](intro/language.md)
4. can instrument **[events](intro/events.md) of different granularity**
5. provide **[behavior](intro/libraries.md) as Wasm functions**, say where to call them in `whamm!`
6. **write instrumentation once**, `whamm!` takes care of the [injection strategy](intro/injection_strategies.md).

Let's take a moment to consider the scale of impact that this DSL could have on developer tooling by considering the following facts:
1. WebAssembly is growing to _use cases beyond the browser_.
2. Many languages can compile to Wasm. 
3. With `whamm!` **write instrumentation once** to support wide domain of apps.
   - Use **engine** instrumentation _capabilities as available_.
   - Use **bytecode rewriting** to _support everything_ else.

This means that developer tools written in `whamm!` could support a **vast domain of applications**, making WebAssembly the **future target platform for debugging**.

## Some helpful terms and concepts ##

1. **[WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/)**:
   WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
   It is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages.
2. **Instrumentation**:
   When we say we are "_instrumenting_ a program," at a high-level we mean we are "_injecting some code_ into a programâ€™s execution to _do some operation_."
   This definition is intentionally generic since instrumentation can really do anything we can imagine!
   You can use instrumentation to build debuggers, dynamic analyses, telemetry generators, and more.
3. **Dynamic analysis**:
   A dynamic analysis is something that analyzes a program as it is executing (in contrast to a static analysis which analyzes a program that is not running).
   This type of analysis can gain useful insights into a program as it is able to access information that is not available statically (such as hot code locations, memory accesses over time, code coverage of test suites, etc.).
4. **Bytecode rewriting**:
   This is an example strategy for injecting instrumentation logic into the application.
   It injects instrumentation through literally inserting new instructions into the application bytecode.
