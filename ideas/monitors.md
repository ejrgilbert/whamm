# Monitors TODO #

- [ ] GRP
- [ ] path profiling
- [ ] call stack
- [ ] calls: Tallies direct and indirect calls.
- [ ] blocks: Tallies basic block counts per function.
- [ ] breakpoints: Triggers an external debugger (e.g. gdb) at specified points.
- [ ] const: Tracks constants in various places in the program.
- [ ] control: Tallies execution counts and shows a control-flow graph.
- [ ] coverage: Tallies instruction and basic block coverage.
- [ ] debug: An interactive synchronous debugger with breakpoints and stepping.
- [ ] fprofile: Reports execution time spent in individual functions.
- [ ] globals: Tallies reads and writes to Wasm globals.
- [ ] icount: Tallies instruction counts per function.
- [ ] loops: Tallies counts of loops.
- [ ] memstats: Tallies stats on memory accesses.
- [ ] opcodes: Tallies static and dynamic counts of each Wasm opcode.
- [ ] profile: Reports execution time for entire calling context trees.
- [ ] profile_bytecode: Recovers source level information from bytecode execution
- [ ] r3: Generates a reduced set of event traces for wasm r3 replay module creation.
- [ ] r3-replay:     Replays a module from an R3 trace file.
- [ ] timeout: Enforces a limit on the number of instructions executed.
- [ ] tracepoints: Traces value stack at given points.
- [x] branches: Tallies direct and indirect branches.
- [x] hotness: Tallies "hot" execution path counts.
- [x] icount: Tallies the total number of instructions that ran during program execution.
- [x] cache simulator: Simulates a cache lookup per memory operation
- [x] imix: classifies each Wasm instruction and outputs a trace of instruction classes for offline analysis.
