# The `wei` Target ([#54](https://github.com/ejrgilbert/whamm/issues/54)) #

Keeping track of the basic functionality to add.
- [ ] split out dynamic and static parts of the predicate
- [ ] `special_decl_init` needs to do something different (the assignment needs to happen a SINGLE time, probably in something like the `global_map_init` function)

Now, making it nice/fast/AWESOME:
- [ ] Predicate optimizations, [#163](https://github.com/ejrgilbert/whamm/issues/163)
- [ ] System API, [#137](https://github.com/ejrgilbert/whamm/issues/137)
      - [ ] Reflection
      - [ ] Dynamic match re-evaluation
