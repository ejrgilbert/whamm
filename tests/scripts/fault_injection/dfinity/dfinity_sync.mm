 * This will perform a synchronous fault in Dfinity (return non-zero on call_perform).
 * NOTE: This will instrument and fail EVERY call_perform as there is no predicate on
 *       the target canister, to add granularity, another probe on call_new will need
 *       to be added to collect call site/target canister info.
